# StatusBarApp-v2-Mojave-edition
New icons for better look on macOS Mojave DarkMode

# Installation:
You don't have to install anything, actually.
You just have to copy the content of the extracted zip file in

/Library/Application Support/WLAN/StatusBarApp.app/

...now logout your user and re-login again to see the new look!

This will also install Italian language for the app.

Feel free to contribute as you like!


# Coming Soon! ⬇️
Soon I'll upload specific icons for light bar and dark bar in two separate releases ;)
